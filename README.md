ExternalScreen
==============

The Cordova iOS ExternalScreen Plugin is a native Plugin for PhoneGap/Apache Cordova which enables multi-screen application scenarios for PhoneGap projects. This plugin is only for for iOS devices.

Code adapted for plugman from:
https://github.com/triceam/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iPhone/ExternalScreen

I plan to submit this to PhoneGap:Build soon.
